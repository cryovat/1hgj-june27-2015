This is an entry for the [1 Hour Game Jam](http://weekjam.com/) ("Rainbows"). The game is called Fruitbat, and
the goal is to eat pineapples to stay alive for as long as possible. I got overtly ambitious (spent ~20 minutes
on the graphics and was too green on Unity) and couldn't finish in time. The **Original** link shows what state
the game was in ~10 minutes over the deadline. The **post-compo** version is at the "playable" point.

Unfortunately, Unity crashed and the scene file got lost. Ah well. :pensive:
